#Description

This is Stratum Proxy for Monero-pools (RPCv2) using asynchronous networking written in Python Twisted.

# # #

If you lost connections to your proxy and have a lot of users, check limits of your system in /etc/security/limits.conf

The best way to increase limits of open files:

 proxyuser hard nofile 1048576
 
 proxyuser soft nofile 1048576
